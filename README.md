1. Construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this
model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart
Disease Data Set.  

2. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the
Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.

3. Demonstrate the working of EM algorithm to cluster a set of data
stored in a .CSV file.

4. Demonstrate Pre processing (Data Cleaning, Integration and
Transformation) activity on suitable data: For example: Identify and Delete Rows that
Contain Duplicate Data by considering an appropriate dataset. Identify and Delete Columns
That Contain a Single Value by considering an appropriate dataset.


5. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file,
implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm. Output a
description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

6. Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most
specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the
training data from a .CSV file and show the output for test cases. Develop an interactive
program by Comparing  the result by
implementing LIST THEN ELIMINATE algorithm.
