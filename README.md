#Program 1
Demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.

#Program 2
Demonstrate the working of the Random forest algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.

#Program 3
Demonstrate the working of SVM classifier for a suitable data set.

#Program 4
Consider a set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm. Output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

#Program 5
Develop a program to apply K-means algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using EM algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering.
 
#Program 6
Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
